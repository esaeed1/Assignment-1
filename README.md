# Assignment 1
A Obj loader/viewer using Nanogui and Tinyobjloader

# Tiny OBJ Loader
*  Wavefront obj loader written in C++03. No dependency except for C++ STL.
*  https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader


# NanoGUI
* NanoGUI builds on GLFW for cross-platform OpenGL context creation and event handling, GLAD to use OpenGL 3.x or higher Windows, Eigen for basic vector types, and NanoVG to draw 2D primitives.
* https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui

This code was made using this code 
https://github.com/stephane-lb/tinyobjviewer
and made modifications to allow for 

* Translate the model / camera in X, Y and Z directions.	- Sliders
* Change the field of view of the camera â€“ both horizontal and vertical. - Button
* (Change the values of the near and far clipping plane. - Slider
* Reseting view - Button
* Zoom in and zoom out view of the model. - Mouse
* Wireframe - Button

* Rotate the model / camera around X, Y, and Z axes.
* Rotate the model /camera according to the moving direction and distance of the mouse.
* Rotate the model around non-major axes as intuitively as possible!
